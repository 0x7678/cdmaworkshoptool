*FAQ*

  * What is cdmaDevLib vs cdmaDevTerm? cdmaDevLib is a library which enables the functions in cdmaDevTerm

  * Could I please have the source code to cdmaDevTerm? of course, it is GPL v3 software. Click the source tab, and checkout from svn(I use tortoiseSvn personally)

  * Why is the code so bad? lots of reasons. But it _is_ free and open.

  * How can I help make cdmaDevTerm better? Many ways: report bugs, submit patches, make community content, write a walk-through, suggest features or changes

  * Why is cdmaDevTerm free? I like making free software. I use alot of free software. 

  * What features are experimental? If checked out from source and built with the debug flag set there are some features like efs which are _highly_ experimental and are really only recommended to use if you'd like to help develop these features. (if you would like a general purpose cdma program which does read efs check out bitpim or revskills)
  
  * Can I donate to cdmaDevTerm? For now at least there is no way to donate directly to support development effort, however, if you would like to make a donation to a charitable organization and email something we can post here it would probably help motivate programmers to work for free
