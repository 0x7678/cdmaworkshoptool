v1.0 Release Candidate 1
Bugfixes:
- Fixed displaying bytes in decimal in Seem Info group box when loading a seem
  from a file.  Now correctly shows bytes in HEX.
- Fixed text boxes so they properly limit the number of characters that can be entered
- Fixed a crash when a seem loaded from a file has changed and you attemp to open
  another file.
- Fixed a crash when trying to open a file that doesn't exist.
Changes:
- The Open File dialog now has filters for Seem files (*.seem) and All files (*.*)
- The Save File dialog now has filters for Seem files (*.seem) and All files (*.*)
- Added a Decimal text box in the Selected Byte Details section which displays the
  the value of the selected byte in decimal format, and allows the user to set the
  value of the byte by entering their own decimal number like you can in MoST.
- Added a drop-down list of *.csv files in the program directory that allows you to
  change the .csv file used for bit/seem descriptions on the fly.  Allows for configs
  for multiple phones to be used.
- When loading a file the Bytes textbox under the Read section now resets to zero
  since the bytes left over in the box do not reflect the number of bytes loaded
  from the file.

v1.0 Beta 2
Bugfixes:
- Fixed bug where certain seems wouldn't pull correctly or pulled at all 00's
- Fixed instances of code that failed to check for invalid characters in Hex 
  strings that could cause crashes
- Fixed .csv file code that seem descriptions are placed in the Info: label in 
  the Selected Byte Details group box (See README.txt for info on this)
- Fixed the main window title to reflect the correct version
- Fixed Bytes: in seem info from showing in decimal instead of HEX
Changes:
- Updated bit descriptions code to support offsets greater than FF
- Removed "Partial Suspend Phone" button since I don't know of any use for this
  phone state
- Changed Bytes text box in the Load group box to be only 4 characters instead
  8 since nobody will ever need to pull anything that large (p2k/p2k05 doesn't
  support it anyways).
- Changed the order the phone info loads to be more streamlined
- Lowered the read from phone timeout for p2k to 10 seconds from original of 40
